## Adding a sample problem

The sample data is defined in [spark-sample-data.xlsx](./spark-sample-data.xlsx)

Here are the steps needed to add a new problem along with problem varients

1. Find yourself in the `Users` tab, and make note of your user `id`
2. Add a new category in `Categories` tab if needed
3. Add problem definition in `Problems` tab
   - Note: you can leave `prefferedVarient` empty for now, we will come back and add it later
4. Add a problem-category link in the `ProblemCategoryLinks` tab
5. Add problem varients in `ProblemVarients` tab
   - Start with the ROOT, and create root problem that is you are passionate about
   - Create broader problem varients: think about how you can draft a problem statement that has higher impact than the root. Keep doing this for several Braoder varients
   - Do the same thing as previous step, only for narrower varients
6. Select your favorite varient, and go back the your `problem` definition and fill in the `prefferedVarient` id
7. Add ratings for your favorite problem variant in the `ProblemVariantRatings` table
8. Create a list of 3-5 sub problems for your preffered variant in `SubProblems` table
9. You are done
