# Identifiers used that are not created via the API

Probably have to be preloaded into DB

`applicationId`: "Unique ID representing the Application"
`applicationServerProviderId`: "Unique ID representing the Application Provider"
`appResourceName`: "App Resource Name. A string identifier for a set of app resources."

Also, missing ID definition even though created in API
`app_hosted_service`

Only 1 Post defined
`POST /sample` { sample_create_update }
